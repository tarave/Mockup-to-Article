You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

1)  I already had a baseline familiarity with HTML, so I think the new skills that I've learned are mainly some of the problem solving strategy skills. For example, learning how to look up new HTML elements, etc.
2)  The HTML coding has been pretty easy so far because I already had some familiarity with that.
3)  I don't think anything has really been very difficult so far. Understanding the relative vs. absolute addresses was a little confusing.
4)  I've used them to look up new HTML elements that I didn't know existed.
